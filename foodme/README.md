# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

Food.Me is a responsive Ruby on Rails app that allows users to create and manage their favorite recipes using "recipe boxes" that contain whichever recipes a user wants. Users can create many "themed" boxes for their recipes and the recipes can be assigned to many boxes as well! I designed the responsive UX/UI for Food.Me using a combination of Bootstrap, Jquery Plugins, and CSS styling to achieve the "parallax" effect.

I want Food.Me to require Users have an account and be signed in.

I want Food.Me to allow Users to Store the recipes they create into whichever box(es) they choose.
